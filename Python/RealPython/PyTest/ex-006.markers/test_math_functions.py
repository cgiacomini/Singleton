# pytest provides a few marks out of the box:

# skip: skips a test unconditionally.
# skipif:  skips a test if the expression passed to it evaluates to True.
# xfail:  indicates that a test is expected to fail, so if the test does fail, 
#         the overall suite can still result in a passing status.
# parametrize: creates multiple variants of a test with different values 
#         as arguments. Youâ€™ll learn more about this mark shortly.
