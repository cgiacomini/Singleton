Goal:	Show how user-defined data types can be used in step parameters.
User-defined data types simplify the processing in step definitions. The string parameters are automatically parsed and converted into specific data types.

Note

Besides conversion into a user-defined type, this mechanism can also be used for text transformations that occurs before the parameter is handed to the step definition function.
