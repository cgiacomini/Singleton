Goal:	Reuse a sequence of existing steps as a step-macro.

In some case, you want to replace a number of steps in a scenario by one simple macro step (macro functionality). To avoid code duplication in the test automation layer, the BDD framework normally provides a functionality to easily call these steps from within a step definition.
